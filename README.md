<h1 align="center">Chrome-Extension</h1>

Chrome Extensions are something which we use very frequently in our day-to-day life for example Grammarly, In this project similarly, I will be adding some extensions and along with it giving some ideas of extensions that can be implemented. Using extension makes life easier but what if we build an extension it makes it more exciting. So you may be on any level of learning you can always contribute to this project and build your very own extensions!

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Branch naming convention is as following

`TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION`

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new chrome-extension
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **fix** - a bug fix

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `master`
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )

4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
6. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
7. Get a code review approval/reject
8. After approval, merge your PR 
9. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).
10. Yey! you made it! üòÉ
